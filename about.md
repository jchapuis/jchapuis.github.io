Passionate software engineer and functional coder. I love creating systems that scale and delight users. 

I'm currently at [ZF](https://www.zf.com/products/en/cv/fleet/mobility_service_orchestration/mobility_service_orchestration_solution.html) as a Principal Software Engineer, where we bring the fleet orchestration technology we developed at [Bestmile](https://www.letemps.ch/economie/renens-teste-un-bus-microtransit-urbain) to a large scale with multi-thousand vehicle fleets.

Previously I was employee #10 at [Nexthink](https://www.nexthink.com/) where I made important contributions to its revolutionary software for user-centric enterprise IT, which has now grown to a billion-dollar worth business. 

Before Nexthink, I had created an [application for computer-aided surgery](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4167891) which was used at several hospitals, for which I earned my Ph.D. at the University of Bern in 2006. I am also an EPFL graduate, where I earned my M.Sc. in 2001.

I've also done some teaching at the [HEIG-VD engineering school](https://reds.heig-vd.ch/) and I regularly speak at conferences and meetups. I also try to contribute to open source as much as possible and have created the OSS library [endless4s](https://endless4s.github.io/) for describing sharded and event sourced entities using tagless-final algebras.
